# The-Titanic-Survival-Analysis

## 1 Introduction
This report presents a comprehensive analysis of the Titanic Survival Chal-
lenge. Our project’s goal is to construct a predictive model using passenger
data from the Titanic disaster, aiming to identify determinants of survival.
We delve into exploratory data analysis (EDA), data preprocessing, and ma-
chine learning to understand the patterns, relationships, and anomalies in
the data, ultimately predicting survival outcomes.

## 3 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Our EDA aimed to uncover patterns, anomalies, and relationships within the
Titanic dataset. This in-depth analysis was pivotal in guiding our subsequent
data preprocessing and modeling strategies.

### 3.1 Data Insights and Interpretation
Passenger Demographics: A detailed inspection of passenger demograph-
ics revealed noteworthy patterns. The survival rate varied significantly across
different age groups, genders, and socio-economic classes. Particularly, younger
passengers and women exhibited higher survival rates. This observation
aligns with historical accounts emphasizing the prioritization of women and
children during lifeboat evacuations.
Socio-Economic Status: Our analysis uncovered a clear socio-economic
divide in survival chances. Passengers from higher socio-economic classes
(reflected in features like passenger class and fare) showed a higher likelihood
